# Written Report Deliverable 3
## Overview of Project
We are given raw data from our client, Louise, and need to help guide her into a new business venture based on data-driven conclusions.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the outcomes of previous business ventures in this creative space. Using said data, we can inform different aspects of the investment for our client, including but not limited to: Outcomes based on Launch Date, Outcomes based on total investment, and percentage successful. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was performed by downloading the raw data from the Kickstarter workbook. The primary challenge was re-remembering how to operate excel seeing how it has been nearly a decade since I needed to use excel extensively.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From the workbook we filtered by Parent Category and Year, for Columns we chose outcome, for Rows we chose Date Created Conversion, and for Values we chose Count of outcomes. This resulted in producing Deliverable 1. https://github.com/hillinhank/kickstarter-analysis-/blob/main/Challenge-1-Deliverable-1.xlsx

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For Deliverable 2, we created the Column Headers: Goal, Number Successful, Number Failed, Number Cancelled, Total Projects, Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, and Percentage Canceled. In the Goal column we created dollar amount ranges to later filter by. After creating algorithms for each cell and populating, the spreadsheet looked like this:https://github.com/hillinhank/kickstarter-analysis-/blob/main/Challenge-1-Deliverable-2.xlsx
We were also asked to create a visual based on these findings:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
My main challenges were in getting familiarized with my new computer and getting it up to date. For instance, the Outcomes Based on Goals chart was providing the wrong numbers in the visual and I had to troubleshoot for several hours. I am not sure what I did, but it did eventually work.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	1-May has more successful launches than any other month, thus it is 	most likely the best time to launch.
	2-December has the fewest number of successful launches, thus it is 	most likely the worst time to launch 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The $25,000 to $29,999 investment column had a success rate of 20%. Similarly, the $30,000 to $34,999 column had a success rate of just 27%.  It may be safe to conclude that more money does not equal more success in this arena. Additionally, productions with investments less than $1000 had a success rate of 76%, and similarly, productions in the $1000 to $4,999 range saw a success rate of 73%. Again, it may be safe to conclude that more money does not equal more success, in this arena.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The higher investment ranges did not have very much data to work with. All investments of $40,000 and more only had 16 projects in total. There are 1043 total projects. Thus, all investment of $40,000 or more comprises only 1.5% of the total projects. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
It may be interesting to take inflation into consideration when considering investment. This may shift the data for a more honest review. It may also be beneficial to further consider what the successful ventures had in common in regards to location.
